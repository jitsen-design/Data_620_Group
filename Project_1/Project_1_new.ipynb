    "**Dataset** \n",
    "The data used in this project is from SG&R law firm, a U.S. corporate law firm in New England. It contains network measurements for 71 attorneys from 1988-1991. There are three types of relationships measured, i.e. co-worker, advice, and social. Attorneys are classified as partners or associates and the data contains gender classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Co-worker Network** \n",
    "Attorneys were asked to go through a list of names and mark off those that they had worked with in the last year, either working on the same case or reading/using some of each other's work product.\n",

    "Attorneys were asked to go through a list of names and mark off those that they had gone to for professional advice in the last year.\n",

    "\n",
    "Degree centrality and eigenvector centrality will be calculated for the nodes in each of the network types. These centrality measures will then be compared by gender.

    "### Degree Centrality vs Eigenvector Centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "Degree centrality is simply the normalized number of degrees for each node. Nodes with a higher number of degrees are of more importance to the network. Eigenvector centrality assigns scores to each connection, where connections to other well connected nodes are valued higher than to low-connected nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is eigenvector centrality important?\n",
    "\n",
    "It creates a level playing field among those who have lots of connections and those who have meaningful connections. For example, if someone has five connections, each of whom have ten connections, that's could be more valuable than having ten connections, each of whom in turn have just three connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of clarity, we will be looking at eigenvector centrality across gender and role (partner or associate). For simplicity, this network uses gender as opposed to sex, even though in reality sex would be the more accurate an would incorporate more identities than the gender binary.\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally, we see strong positive correlation between eigenvector centrality and degree centrality, indicating that irrespective of the network, lawyers are connected to other lawyers who have similar reach. However, the social network showed up as less correlated than the other two, since social interactions are a little more organic than advice networks and co-work networks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Males vs Females\n",
    "\n",
    "On average males have a stronger social, advice and co-work network. This could also be informed by the fact that males outnumber women 3 to 1. Among males ids 23 and 25 feature strongly in all three networks. Id 12 seems to be less significant in the co-work network than in other networks perhaps due to shorter tenure. Among women, ids 28, 37 and 38 were influential in all three networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partners vs Associates\n",
    "\n",
    "Partners showed up as more central than associates in all networks, with the exception of id 40, who is a male. He showed up as prominent in the social and advice networks. We also have id 64 who showed up as central in the social network.\n",
